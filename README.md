# Angular 2 Tour of Heroes (in dart) demo with Rails 5 API Backend

I followed the Angular 2 tutorial, with DART, and then replaced the mock service
with a Rails 5 API only backend.  I then modified the hero_service to utilise the
new backend.  Feel free to hit me up with any questions.

To launch the Angular APP, you'll need the Dart SDK.  Once installed

`$ pub get`

`$ pub serve`

To run the Rails backend, simply type

`$ bundle install`

`$ rails s`

Open a browser at http://localhost:8080 and you're ready to go.
